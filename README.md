### External Libs Used

1. [ismobilejs](https://github.com/kaimallea/isMobile) - [bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=ismobilejs@1.0.3)
   - Gives a great way of knowing devices beforehand
2. [deep-object-diff](https://github.com/mattphillips/deep-object-diff) - [bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=deep-object-diff@1.1.0)
   - Great lib to dive into object differences
3. [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) - [bundlephobia](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=styled-components@4.4.1)
   - Chosen due to its simplicity in delivering independent and reusable styled components and its powerful ability to understand SASS like syntax
4. [unstated-next](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated-next/)
   - Incredibly small state management lib using hooks
